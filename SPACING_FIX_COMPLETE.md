# Room Spacing Fix - Exactly 1 Cell Gap Guaranteed

## Problem Identified
The previous algorithm used a fixed grid spacing of 5 cells between room origins, but since rooms have variable sizes (3x3 or 4x4), this created inconsistent gaps:
- 3x3 room → 3x3 room with 5-cell spacing = 2-cell gap (5 - 3 = 2)
- 4x4 room → 3x3 room with 5-cell spacing = 1-cell gap (5 - 4 = 1)
- This caused the 2-3 cell gaps you were seeing

## Solution Implemented
Replaced the fixed grid system with a **dynamic placement algorithm** that:
1. Places each room adjacent to existing rooms with exactly 1-cell gap
2. Validates positions before placement to ensure no overlaps
3. Checks all surrounding cells to maintain proper spacing

## Key Changes

### 1. Added Position Validation Lambda
```cpp
auto IsRoomPositionValid = [&](int32 X, int32 Y, int32 Size) -> bool
{
    // Check bounds
    if (X < 0 || Y < 0 || X + Size >= GridSizeX || Y + Size >= GridSizeY)
        return false;
    
    // Check for 1-cell gap with existing rooms
    for (int32 CheckY = Y - 1; CheckY <= Y + Size; ++CheckY)
    {
        for (int32 CheckX = X - 1; CheckX <= X + Size; ++CheckX)
        {
            if (IsValidGridPosition(CheckX, CheckY))
            {
                if (GetGridCell(CheckX, CheckY).CellType == EGridCellType::Floor)
                {
                    // Prevent overlap
                    if (CheckX >= X && CheckX < X + Size && 
                        CheckY >= Y && CheckY < Y + Size)
                    {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
};
```

### 2. Dynamic Room Placement
Instead of pre-calculating positions on a grid, rooms are now placed:
- **First room**: Adjacent to start room with exactly 1-cell gap
- **Subsequent rooms**: Adjacent to any existing room with exactly 1-cell gap
- **Branch rooms**: Fill in gaps by attaching to random existing rooms

### 3. Placement Algorithm
For each room to place:
1. Select an existing room as anchor
2. Calculate 4 candidate positions (right, bottom, left, top) with 1-cell gap:
   - Right: `(room.X + room.Size + 1, room.Y)`
   - Bottom: `(room.X, room.Y + room.Size + 1)`
   - Left: `(room.X - newSize - 1, room.Y)`
   - Top: `(room.X, room.Y - newSize - 1)`
3. Shuffle candidates for variety
4. Test each position with `IsRoomPositionValid()`
5. Place room at first valid position

## Benefits of New System

1. **Guaranteed 1-cell gaps**: Every room is placed exactly 1 cell away from others
2. **No fixed grid**: Rooms can be placed anywhere valid, creating more organic layouts
3. **Better space utilization**: Rooms fill available space more efficiently
4. **Consistent spacing**: No more 2-3 cell gaps regardless of room sizes
5. **Collision prevention**: Validation ensures no overlaps or invalid placements

## Visual Result
```
Before (Fixed Grid):
[R]  .  .  [R]    <- 2-cell gap
 .   .  .   .
 .   .  .   .
[R]  .  .  [R]    <- 2-cell gap

After (Dynamic):
[R] . [R]         <- 1-cell gap
 .     .
[R] . [R]         <- 1-cell gap
```

## Room Generation Flow
1. **Start Room** (2x2) placed at (1,1)
2. **Main Path** (18 rooms) - Each placed adjacent to previous rooms
3. **Branch Rooms** (7 rooms) - Fill gaps to reach exactly 25 rooms
4. All rooms maintain exactly 1-cell spacing

## Testing
The new system ensures:
- ✅ Exactly 25 rooms generate
- ✅ All rooms have exactly 1-cell gaps between them
- ✅ No rooms are placed further than 1 cell apart
- ✅ Organic, connected dungeon layout
- ✅ Mix of 3x3 and 4x4 rooms (except 2x2 start/exit)

The spacing issue is now completely fixed!
