- [ ] **ProceduralGenerationSystem.md** - Room and floor generation (16ms target)
- [ ] **PlayerCharacterSystem.md** - Player movement and basic abilities
- [ ] **CombatSystem.md** - Combat mechanics and damage
- [ ] **EntitySystem.md** - ADA (Adaptive Dungeon Algorithm)
- [ ] **HUDSystem.md** - User interface and display

### Supporting Systems (Version 0.1.0+)
- [ ] **SaveSystem.md** - Game progress saving and loading
- [ ] **InventorySystem.md** - Item management and equipment
- [ ] **AudioSystem.md** - Sound effects and music
- [ ] **WeaponSystem.md** - Weapon mechanics and rune customization

### Advanced Systems (Version 0.2.0+)
- [ ] **AdvancedEntitySystem.md** - Sophisticated entity intelligence
- [ ] **LivingMaterialsSystem.md** - Dynamic material system
- [ ] **PsychologicalWarfareSystem.md** - Advanced psychological elements

## Template Usage

### How to Use the Template:
1. **Copy SYSTEM_TEMPLATE.md** for each new system
2. **Fill in the brackets** with specific information
3. **Update version status** as development progresses
4. **Link dependencies** to other system documents

### Template Sections:
- **Overview:** What the system does and why it's needed
- **Core Functions:** Main features and their purposes
- **Performance Requirements:** 16ms target and entity integration
- **Basic Usage:** Simple code examples
- **Testing:** What to test and how
- **Implementation Notes:** Blueprint/C++ split and architecture
- **Dependencies:** What systems it needs and what uses it
- **Version Status:** Current development status

## Development Guidelines

### Performance First:
- **16ms Generation:** All procedural systems must meet this target
- **60 FPS Gameplay:** All interactive systems must maintain this
- **Entity Integration:** All systems must work with ADA

### Modular Architecture:
- **Parent-Child Classes:** Every system uses this pattern
- **Blueprint-C++ Hybrid:** Use each for their strengths
- **Scale Consistency:** 1x1 cubic = 1 cube = 1 cell

### Documentation Standards:
- **Keep It Simple:** Start with basic structure, refine later
- **Focus on Essentials:** Performance and entity integration first
- **Update Regularly:** Keep documentation current with development
