## Overview

EternalDescent has been enhanced with delightful, whimsical moments designed to transform potential frustrations into joyful, shareable experiences.

## Key Whimsical Systems

### 1. ADA Personality Overhaul

**Enhanced AI Character**: ADA is now a lovable, quirky dungeon master with distinct personality phases:

#### Observer Phase (Floors 1-10)
- *"whispers* The dungeon is... curious about you"
- *"Oh! That's a neat way to do that!"
- *"scribbles notes frantically*"
- *"Even the rats stopped to watch that move"

#### Tester Phase (Floors 11-25)
- *"rubs digital hands together* Let's play!"
- *"I made you a little puzzle! Hope you like surprises~"
- *"giggles in binary* Try this on for size!"
- *"Consider this my love letter to your skills"

#### Counter Phase (Floors 26-50)
- *"politely clears throat* Um, excuse me, but no."
- *"Nah-uh! I've seen that movie before!"
- *"chuckles warmly* Oh honey, you'll need to be more creative than that"
- *"Time to improvise! I believe in you!"

#### Dominator Phase (Floors 51+)
- *"dramatic flourish* Behold my masterpiece!"
- *"evil laugh* MUAHAHAHA... wait, was that too much?"
- *"takes a bow* This level is my magnum opus"
- *"You've taught me so much... time to return the favor!"
