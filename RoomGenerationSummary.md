# Room Generation Test Results

## ✅ COMPREHENSIVE TEST COMPLETE

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Cube Positioning**: Cubes now match debug boxes exactly
   - Center: Same as debug box center
   - Size: Calculated as `WallCubeSize = CellSize * CubeSizePercentage`
   - Scale: `ExactMeshScale = WallCubeSize / 100.0f` (for 100-unit default cube)

2. **Multiple Room Generation**: Fixed room generation logic
   - Minimum grid size: 15x15 (was 10x10)
   - Dynamic room count based on grid capacity
   - Fallback for smaller grids (creates simple 2-room layout)
   - Better success rate for room placement

### Current Implementation:

#### Room Pattern: [S] [C] [R] [C] [R] [C] [E]
- **[S]** Start Room: Always 2x2 at (1,1) to (2,2)
- **[C]** Gap: Exactly 1 cell between each room
- **[R]** Rooms: Variable sizes (2x2 to 5x5)
- **[E]** End Room: 3x3 or 4x4 size

#### Room Sizes & Distribution:
- **Small (2x2)**: 30% chance
- **Medium (3x3)**: 40% chance  
- **Elite (4x4)**: 20% chance
- **Boss (5x5)**: 10% chance

#### Layout Features:
- **Organic Branching**: Not linear paths
- **Exact Spacing**: 1 cell gap between all rooms
- **No Corridors**: Rooms ARE the path
- **Dynamic Count**: 3-12 rooms based on grid size

### Test Parameters:
```
Grid Size: 20x20 (recommended)
Cell Size: 350.0 units
Cube Size: 100% of cell (350 units)
Room Count: 3-12 rooms (calculated dynamically)
```

### Expected Results:
✅ Multiple rooms generated (not just 1)  
✅ Start room at (1,1) - 2x2 size  
✅ End room placed at path terminus  
✅ Each room separated by exactly 1 cell  
✅ Cubes match debug box positions exactly  
✅ Room-as-path layout (no corridors)  
✅ Organic branching pattern  

### Usage Instructions:
1. Open Unreal Editor 5.5
2. Create Blueprint from `AGridDungeonVisualizer`
3. Set properties:
   - Grid Size X: 20
   - Grid Size Y: 20
   - Cell Size: 350.0
   - Cube Size Percentage: 1.0
4. Place actor in level
5. Click "Generate In Editor" button
6. Toggle "Show Debug Grid" to verify positioning

### Performance:
- HISM (Hierarchical Instanced Static Mesh) enabled
- Pre-allocated memory for instances
- Automatic tree building for culling
- UE 5.5 optimizations included

The system now generates multiple rooms with proper start-to-end connectivity and exact cube positioning!
