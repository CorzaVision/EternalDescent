# Mixed Room Size Implementation Validation

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented mixed room sizes for the GridDungeonVisualizer:

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Added Room Type System:**
   - `ERoomSizeType` enum with `Small_2x2` and `Standard_3x3` values
   - `FGridRoomInfo` struct to track room information including size, type, and center position
   - `RoomInfoList` member variable to store room information

2. **Updated Room Placement Logic:**
   - `MarkPathInGrid()` now handles mixed room sizes (2x2 for START/END, 3x3 for others)
   - Added `Mark2x2RoomInGrid()` function for placing 2x2 rooms
   - START room (index 0): 2x2 size
   - END room (last index): 2x2 size  
   - All other rooms: 3x3 size

3. **Enhanced Path Generation Validation:**
   - `IsValidMoveForVariableRooms()` function validates placement with proper spacing for mixed room sizes
   - `CalculateRequiredDistance()` computes minimum center-to-center distance for 1 cell gap
   - Updated `GenerateSnakePath()` to use variable room validation

4. **Mixed Room Spacing Validation:**
   - `ValidateMixedRoomSpacing()` function ensures all rooms maintain exactly 1 cell spacing
   - Handles different boundary calculations for 2x2 vs 3x3 rooms
   - 2x2 room at center (X,Y) occupies cells (X,Y) to (X+1,Y+1)
   - 3x3 room at center (X,Y) occupies cells (X-1,Y-1) to (X+1,Y+1)

5. **Updated Debug Visualization:**
   - `DrawRoomDebugInfo()` shows different room sizes with appropriate labels
   - Visual distinction between START (2x2), END (2x2), and REGULAR (3x3) rooms
   - Updated animation and step-through functions for mixed room placement

## Spacing Rules Implemented:

### Room Size Definitions:
- **2x2 room**: Occupies 4 cells in a 2x2 grid starting from center position
- **3x3 room**: Occupies 9 cells in a 3x3 grid centered on position

### Spacing Requirements:
- **2x2 to 2x2**: Centers minimum 3 cells apart (ensures 1 cell gap between boundaries)
- **2x2 to 3x3**: Variable spacing based on `CalculateRequiredDistance()` formula
- **3x3 to 3x3**: Centers minimum 4 cells apart (maintains 1 cell gap)

### Distance Formula:
```cpp
float RequiredDistance = (Room1Size + Room2Size) / 2.0f + 1.0f;
```

**Examples:**
- 2x2 to 2x2: (2 + 2) / 2 + 1 = 3.0 cells
- 2x2 to 3x3: (2 + 3) / 2 + 1 = 3.5 cells  
- 3x3 to 3x3: (3 + 3) / 2 + 1 = 4.0 cells

## Files Modified:

### Header File (`GridDungeonVisualizer.h`):
- Added `ERoomSizeType` enum
- Added `FGridRoomInfo` struct
- Added `RoomInfoList` member variable
- Added new function declarations

### Implementation File (`GridDungeonVisualizer.cpp`):
- Updated `MarkPathInGrid()` for mixed room sizes
- Added `Mark2x2RoomInGrid()` function
- Added `IsValidMoveForVariableRooms()` function
- Added `ValidateMixedRoomSpacing()` function
- Added `CalculateRequiredDistance()` function
- Added `IsValid2x2RoomPosition()` function
- Updated debug visualization functions
- Updated logging messages throughout

## Expected Behavior:

1. **Generation**: START room will be 2x2, END room will be 2x2, all others will be 3x3
2. **Spacing**: All rooms maintain exactly 1 cell spacing between their boundaries
3. **Validation**: System validates spacing during generation and reports any violations
4. **Visualization**: Debug display shows room sizes and types clearly differentiated

## Testing Recommendations:

1. Run generation and verify START/END rooms are visually 2x2
2. Check that regular rooms remain 3x3
3. Validate that `ValidateSpacing()` function reports no violations
4. Test with various grid sizes to ensure robustness
5. Verify debug visualization shows correct room type labels

## Performance Notes:

- Uses the same HISM (Hierarchical Instanced Static Mesh) optimization
- Room tracking adds minimal overhead with `TArray<FGridRoomInfo>`
- Validation functions are called only during generation, not runtime
- No impact on target 16ms generation time

The implementation maintains the existing performance characteristics while adding the flexibility for mixed room sizes with precise 1-cell spacing control.
