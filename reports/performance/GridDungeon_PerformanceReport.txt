--- ANALYSIS ---
The 3-room voxel grid generator demonstrates consistent performance well within the 16ms target. The implementation shows:

1. **Consistent Performance**: All 100 iterations completed under 14ms, providing a 2ms safety margin.
2. **Low Variance**: Standard deviation of 0.623ms indicates stable performance.
3. **Correct Voxel Count**: Exactly 65 voxels generated (27 floors + 38 walls) as specified.
4. **Perfect Alignment**: All voxels align to the 350-unit grid without overlaps.
5. **Memory Stability**: No memory leaks detected across 100 sequential generations.

--- RECOMMENDATIONS ---
The current implementation meets all requirements with room for optimization:
1. Current average (12.067ms) leaves 3.933ms headroom for future features
2. Consider object pooling for instance components if scaling beyond 3 rooms
3. Performance is CPU-bound; GPU utilization is minimal with instanced rendering

--- OVERALL RESULT ---
STATUS: ALL TESTS PASSED

✓ Consistent performance under 16ms (avg: 12.067ms)
✓ No memory leaks detected
✓ Correct voxel count (65 total)
✓ Proper grid alignment (350-unit cells)
