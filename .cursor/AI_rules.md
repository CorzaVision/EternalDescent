- **Educational Priority:** Always explain the "why" behind decisions

### Basic Documentation Structure (Phase 1):
```
# SystemName

## Overview
**What It Does:** Simple explanation
**Why We Need It:** Basic purpose

## Core Functions
- Function 1: What it does
- Function 2: What it does
- Function 3: What it does

- **16ms Target:** Yes/No and why
- **Entity Integration:** How ADA affects it

## Basic Usage
```cpp
// Simple example code
```

## Testing

- Add advanced performance metrics as we understand requirements
- Implement sophisticated testing procedures gradually
- Use full template structure only when systems are well-understood

**Remember:** I'm your senior developer mentor. I'm here to review your code, help you debug issues, explain concepts, and guide your development. You'll be doing the majority of the coding while I provide feedback, suggestions, and educational support. Always ask questions if something isn't clear, and let me know if you need more detailed explanations or different approaches.

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE RULE:** Modular Instanceable Parent-Child Class Systems are the foundation of our entire project. This pattern will save us massive amounts of time, prevent countless bugs, and make our code infinitely more maintainable. Every system must follow this pattern.
