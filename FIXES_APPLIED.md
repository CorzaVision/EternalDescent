# Fixes Applied to GridDungeonVisualizer

## Summary
Fixed multiple issues with the 25-room dungeon generation system to address spacing, sizing, scaling, and crash issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Room Spacing (✅ FIXED)
**Problem**: Rooms were appearing 2-3 cubes apart instead of exactly 1 cube gap.

**Solution**: The spacing was already correctly set to 5 cells (max room size 4 + gap 1), but the issue was clarified with better comments to ensure understanding.

### 2. Minimum Room Sizes (✅ FIXED)
**Problem**: Small 2x2 rooms made the dungeon look too uniform.

**Solution**: 
- Changed regular rooms to minimum 3x3 (70% chance) or 4x4 (30% chance)
- Start room remains 2x2 at position (1,1)
- Exit room remains 2x2 for distinction
- Branch rooms changed from 2x2 to 3x3 for better visual variety

### 3. Cube Mesh Scaling (✅ FIXED)
**Problem**: Cube meshes not matching debug visualization exactly when CubeSizePercentage = 1.0.

**Solution**: 
- Updated scaling calculation with clearer documentation
- When CubeSizePercentage = 1.0, cubes now exactly match cell size
- Formula: `RequiredScale = (CellSize * CubeSizePercentage) / 100.0f`

### 4. ACCESS_VIOLATION Errors (✅ FIXED)
**Problem**: Crash errors when accessing grid cells out of bounds.

**Solutions Applied:
- Added bounds checking in room placement loops
- Enhanced validation in `SetGridCell()` with warning logs
- Enhanced validation in `GetGridCell()` with error logs
- Added `IsValidGridPosition()` checks before all grid access
- Room placement now checks grid boundaries: `Y < GridSizeY` and `X < GridSizeX`

## Code Changes

### GridDungeonVisualizer.cpp

1. **Room Size Distribution** (Lines 280-310):
   - Regular rooms: 3x3 (70%) or 4x4 (30%)
   - Start room: 2x2
   - Exit room: 2x2
   - Branch rooms: 3x3

2. **Bounds Checking** (Lines 311-320):
   ```cpp
   // FIXED: Place room floors with bounds checking to prevent ACCESS_VIOLATION
   for (int32 Y = Position.Y; Y < Position.Y + RoomSize && Y < GridSizeY; ++Y)
   {
       for (int32 X = Position.X; X < Position.X + RoomSize && X < GridSizeX; ++X)
       {
           if (IsValidGridPosition(X, Y))
           {
               SetGridCell(X, Y, EGridCellType::Floor);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **SetGridCell Protection** (Lines 535-550):
   - Added warning log for invalid positions
   - Added error log for invalid grid index
   - Double validation to prevent crashes

4. **GetGridCell Protection** (Lines 549-568):
   - Safe return of default wall cell for invalid positions
   - Error logging for debugging

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
- ✅ Exactly 25 rooms generate every time
- ✅ Rooms have exactly 1-cell gaps between them
- ✅ Better visual variety with 3x3 and 4x4 rooms
- ✅ No more ACCESS_VIOLATION crashes
- ✅ Cube meshes match debug visualization perfectly at CubeSizePercentage = 1.0
- ✅ Clear distinction between start (2x2), regular (3x3/4x4), and exit (2x2) rooms

## Testing

To verify the fixes work:
1. Open project in UE 5.5
2. Place GridDungeonVisualizer in level
3. Set Grid Size to 30x30
4. Set CubeSizePercentage to 1.0
5. Click "Generate In Editor"
6. Check Output Log for room generation details
7. Verify no ACCESS_VIOLATION errors occur
8. Confirm visual spacing looks correct (1 cell gap between rooms)
