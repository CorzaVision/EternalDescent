# GridDungeonVisualizer Spacing Fix Analysis

## Performance Issue Identified

**Original Problem**: 30x30 grid generation took 1145ms (should be <16ms)

**Root Cause**: O(nÂ²) complexity in `IsValidMove()` function:
- For each potential move, function checked distance to ALL existing rooms
- With 25 rooms and multiple iteration attempts, this created thousands of calculations

## Performance Fix Applied

**Optimization**: Changed from O(n) to O(1) adjacency checking:
- Old: Check distance to every room in `Visited` set 
- New: Check only 8 immediately adjacent positions

```cpp
// OLD CODE (O(n) - slow)
for (const FIntPoint& ExistingRoom : Visited)
{
    int32 DistX = FMath::Abs(ExistingRoom.X - X);
    int32 DistY = FMath::Abs(ExistingRoom.Y - Y);
    // Complex distance checking...
}

// NEW CODE (O(1) - fast)
TArray<FIntPoint> AdjacentPositions = {
    FIntPoint(X - 1, Y - 1), FIntPoint(X, Y - 1), FIntPoint(X + 1, Y - 1),
    FIntPoint(X - 1, Y),                          FIntPoint(X + 1, Y),
    FIntPoint(X - 1, Y + 1), FIntPoint(X, Y + 1), FIntPoint(X + 1, Y + 1)
};
for (const FIntPoint& AdjPos : AdjacentPositions)
{
    if (Visited.Contains(AdjPos)) return false;
}
```

## Potential New Issue

**Risk**: The new adjacency check might be too restrictive:
- Original logic allowed rooms exactly 2 cells apart (1-cell spacing)
- New logic prevents ANY adjacent rooms (including diagonal)
- This could make it impossible to find valid moves in constrained grids

## Testing Strategy

1. **Quick Performance Test**: Verify 30x30 grid is now <50ms (improvement from 1145ms)
2. **Spacing Validation**: Ensure rooms still maintain 1-cell spacing requirements
3. **Path Generation**: Verify adequate number of rooms are generated
4. **Edge Cases**: Test small grids to ensure algorithm doesn't get stuck

## Expected Results

- **Performance**: 30x30 grid should generate in <50ms (target <16ms)
- **Functionality**: Should generate 15-25 rooms with proper spacing
- **Spacing**: No adjacent rooms, maintain 1-cell gaps

## Fallback Plan

If new algorithm is too restrictive:
1. Implement hybrid approach using spatial grid for fast neighbor lookup
2. Use distance-based checking only for rooms within 3-cell radius
3. Add early termination for spacing validation in MarkPathInGrid()
