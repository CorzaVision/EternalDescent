# Generation Test Results

## Current Generation Output (from ProofTest.log)

### Room Count: ✅ PASS
- Successfully generating exactly 25 rooms

### Room Sizes: ❌ FAIL
Current generation shows:
- Room #1: 2x2 (Start) ✅
- Room #2-18: Mix of 2x2 SMALL, 3x3 MEDIUM, 4x4 ELITE
- Room #19: 3x3 END 
- Room #20-25: 2x2 SMALL (branches)

**Problem**: Still generating 2x2 "SMALL" rooms for regular rooms, not following the new rules:
- Should be: 1 start (2x2), 1 exit (2x2), rest 3x3 or 4x4
- Actually getting: Many 2x2 rooms labeled as "SMALL"

### Room Spacing Analysis
Let's check some room positions from the log:
- Room #1: (1,1) size 2x2 → ends at (2,2)
- Room #6: (7,2) size 2x2 → starts at (7,2)
  - Gap from Room #1: 7 - 3 = 4 cells (TOO FAR!)
- Room #7: (2,7) size 2x2 → starts at (2,7)
  - Gap from Room #1 vertically: 7 - 3 = 4 cells (TOO FAR!)

### Spacing: ❌ FAIL
The rooms are placed on a 5-cell grid (positions like 2, 7, 12, 17, 22) which creates:
- 2x2 room at position 2 ends at 3
- Next room at position 7 starts at 7
- Gap = 7 - 4 = 3 cells (NOT 1 cell!)

## Issues Found

1. **Room Size Distribution Not Applied**
   - The code changes to make rooms 3x3/4x4 didn't take effect
   - Still using old logic with 2x2 "SMALL" rooms

2. **Fixed Grid Spacing Still Active**
   - Rooms placed at fixed intervals (2, 7, 12, 17, 22)
   - This creates 3-4 cell gaps, not 1 cell
   - The dynamic placement algorithm isn't being used

3. **Old Code Still Running**
   - The test is using an older compiled version
   - Our changes haven't been compiled into the DLL

## Solution Required

1. **Recompile the project** with the new changes
2. **Verify the GridDungeonVisualizer.cpp** has:
   - Dynamic placement (not fixed grid)
   - Proper room sizes (3x3/4x4 for regular rooms)
   - Strict 1-cell gap validation

The test results show the OLD algorithm is still running, not our fixed version!
